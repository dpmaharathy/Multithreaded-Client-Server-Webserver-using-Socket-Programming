# Multithreaded-Client-Server-Webserver-using-Socket-Programming
A multithreaded web server coded entirely in python which would fetch the location from the user and display the weather stats for the same.

We have used OpenWeather API to fetch the weather stats of the location given by the user and then retrieved the output file in the form of a JSON file and then
displayed the appropriate stats.
This WebApp can handle multiple requests from multiple clients and both the server and client code are written using the concepts of Socket programming in python.
